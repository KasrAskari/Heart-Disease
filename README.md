# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models trained on clinical data. By leveraging supervised learning algorithms, the project achieves an accuracy of approximately 85-90%, depending on the model and dataset. These results demonstrate the potential for effective early diagnosis and prevention through data-driven insights.

## Features

- Heart disease risk prediction based on patient data.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering for optimal model performance.
- Interactive interface for users to input medical data (if applicable).

## Project Structure
