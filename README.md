# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models trained on clinical data. It focuses on leveraging various supervised algorithms to provide accurate and actionable insights that could aid in early diagnosis and prevention.

## Features

- Heart disease risk prediction based on patient data.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering for optimal model performance.
- Interactive interface for users to input medical data (if applicable).

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`models/`**: Saved machine learning models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data processing and predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, etc., for modeling.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization.
